### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adnan, your friendly neighborhood open-sourcerer at @sematext. ðŸ˜„

In my past, I founded a startup that failed. I've authored online courses. And, I'm an ex-freeCodeCamp local leader.

JavaScript is my main language. I've been creating full stack JavaScript software for the last five years. In the last few years I started fiddling with DevOps, Serverless, and Bash scripts, but also Product Management and Growth.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few open-source Node.js projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything and everything about Node.js, DevOps, and Serverless
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything cool and fun in the open-source Node.js world
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything :smile:
- ðŸ“« [DMs are open on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adnanrahic)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can do magic :rocket:

### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Adnan, your friendly neighborhood ğŸ¥‘ at [@Kubeshop.io](https://kubeshop.io/). ğŸ˜„

I'm a failed startup founder. I've authored online courses. And, I'm an ex-freeCodeCamp local leader.

JavaScript is my main language. I've been creating full-stack JavaScript software for the last five years. In the last few years I started fiddling with DevOps, Serverless, and Bash scripts, but also Product Management and Product Growth.

- ğŸ”­ Currently working on a few open-source Node.js projects
- ğŸŒ± Currently learning anything and everything about Node.js, DevOps, and Serverless
- ğŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on anything cool and fun in the open-source Node.js world
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can do magic :rocket:
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything :smile:

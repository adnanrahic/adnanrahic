### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Adnan! I do all things Developer Relations at [Bindplane](https://bindplane.com).

I'm a failed startup founder. I've authored courses, e-books, and hundreds of blog posts. And, I'm an ex-freeCodeCamp local leader.

JavaScript is my main language. I've crafted full-stack JavaScript software for 5 years. And, spent the last 6 years in Developer Relations and Product Growth.
